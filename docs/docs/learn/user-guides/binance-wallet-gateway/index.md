# Bridge with Binance Web3 Wallet

## Task: Bridge from Bitcoin to BOB

[BOB Gateway](https://app.gobob.xyz) lets you stake, swap, or lend your BTC from a single, unified interface so you can put your bitcoin to work earning yield faster than ever before.

We are partnering with Binance Web3 Wallet to offer this task to their users.

When you're done, you can complete [other Binance Web3 Wallet tasks](#more-tasks-on-bob) on BOB.

## Prerequisites

To complete this task you will need

- At least 0.0001 BTC on the Bitcoin Network in any wallet
- Binance Web3 Wallet (even if you have never used an EVM chain before)

That's it! You do not need any tokens on any EVM chain, including BOB. The Binance Web3 Wallet comes with an EVM address. You will have an option to receive ETH, the fee token on BOB, if you don't have any yet.
