# Stake BTC

## One-Click BTC Staking

[BOB Stake](https://app.gobob.xyz/stake?type=stake&stakeWith=solv-solvbtcbbn) is a new 1-click Bitcoin staking portal and [SDK](/learn/builder-guides/gateway.md) for Bitcoin liquid staking. Harvest BOB Spice points in the final season of BOB Fusion by using BOB Stake and exploring the growing Bitcoin staking ecosystem on BOB.

It's built on a trustless, RFQ-based cross-chain swap protocol that connects professional LPs with users through a seamless swapping experience. LPs handle the complexities of bridging and staking on behalf of users in exchange for a fee.

All you need is a Bitcoin wallet with some BTC to send and an EVM-compatible wallet to receive your Bitcoin LST on BOB. We'll even send you some ETH to cover the fees of your first few transactions on BOB.

## Bonus Spice Points with Intract

You can harvest extra Spice by competing any of these [Intract Campaign](https://www.intract.io/explore?query=BOB&hideCompleted=true&hideExpired=true&sortBy=rankingB&entity_type=CAMPAIGN) tasks with BOB Stake.
