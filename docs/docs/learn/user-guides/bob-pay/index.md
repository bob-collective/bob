# Send BTC to an Email Address

## What is BOB Pay?

[BOB Pay](https://bob-pay.gobob.xyz/) aims to showcase how easy crypto UX can be by focusing on a simple use case popular within the Bitcoin ecosystem: payments.

With BOB Pay, you can send Bitcoin and stablecoins to someone's email address. No wallet, no app, no seed phrase - just simple, cheap, non-custodial, and lightning-fast payments. BOB Pay showcases the power of wallet abstraction with [Dynamic](https://www.dynamic.xyz/), smart accounts from [ZeroDev](https://zerodev.app/), and paymasters from [Pimlico](https://www.pimlico.io/).

We’re offering projects on BOB free access to Dynamic and Pimlico if you’d like to do the same.

## High-Level Technical Summary

1. Alice logs into [BOB Pay](https://pay.gobob.xyz) and sends WBTC to John's email address.
2. [Dynamic generates](https://docs.dynamic.xyz/wallets/embedded-wallets/create-wallets/overview#during-signup-automatic) a deterministic [ZeroDev smart account wallet](https://docs.dynamic.xyz/account-abstraction/aa-providers/zerodev) for John on BOB.
3. John claims their WBTC by [sending their first transaction](https://docs.dynamic.xyz/wallets/embedded-wallets/pregenerated-wallets#after-signup) to Charlie. The transaction fees are paid to a [Paymaster](https://docs.pimlico.io/infra/paymaster/erc20-paymaster) in WBTC so John can transact without holding any ETH.
4. A [guarantor from Pimlico sponsors John's first transaction fees](https://docs.pimlico.io/infra/paymaster/erc20-paymaster/architecture#eoa-guarantor-signature), then claims back the funds after John's first transaction. This solves the problem of John needing ETH to approve the Paymaster's access to their WBTC.
