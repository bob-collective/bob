# Run a Full Node

:::info
There is no protocol level incentive to run a BOB full node. If you’re interested in accessing the BOB chain, but you don’t want to set up your own node, see our [Node Providers](/learn/reference/tools/node-providers) to get RPC access to fully-managed nodes hosted by a third-party provider.
:::

## Requirements

As of August 2024 we recommend you have at least the following hardware configuration to run a node:

- at least 8 GB RAM
- an SSD, preferably NVME drive with at least 100 GB free

Software stack:

- [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

## Resources

Please follow [Conduit's node documentation](https://docs.conduit.xyz/guides/run-a-node/op-stack-node) for information on how to self-host a node for an OP Stack rollup deployed on Conduit such as BOB. Conduit extends [Optimism's guide for running a node with Docker](https://docs.optimism.io/builders/node-operators/tutorials/node-from-docker), the source of the specific hardware and software dependencies above.
