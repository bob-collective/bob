# Integrate BOB Gateway in Your App

[BOB Gateway](https://docs.gobob.xyz/learn/guides/bitcoin-bridge/) is a Bitcoin intent bridge that unlocks Bitcoin liquidity by reducing the number of steps to onboard users to your app, saving time and money. For example, users can go from **BTC** on Bitcoin to **staked BTC LSTs** with a single Bitcoin transaction.

Our SDK makes it possible for you to bring this UX directly into your app.

## How Gateway Works

1. Liquidity providers (LPs) temporarily lock wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC or tBTC) in escrow smart contracts on BOB.
1. A user makes a request for wrapped or staked Bitcoin (e.g. WBTC, tBTC, or a Bitcoin LST/LRT).
1. The user sends BTC to the liquidity provider's Bitcoin address. A hash of the user's order is included in the `OP_RETURN` of the transaction.

1. Gateway finalizes the transaction. After trustlessly verifying the user's Bitcoin transaction with an on-chain [Light Client](/learn/builder-guides/relay.md), Gateway sends the LP's wrapped Bitcoin to the user's EVM address. If the user requested a Bitcoin LST/LRT, that token is minted using the LP's wrapped Bitcoin before it is sent to the user.

This SDK exposes helper functions for steps 2, 3, and 4 to be used in your application's front end.

## Step-by-Step Integration Guide

This is an example implementation of our SDK. You will need to decide how you handle asking your user to sign a partially-signed Bitcoin transaction (PSBT). We recommend using our [sats-wagmi](/learn/builder-guides/sats-wagmi.md) package to connect to your users' wallets.

### Install the BOB SDK

Add `@gobob/bob-sdk` to your project using your preferred package manager.

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @gobob/bob-sdk
```

### Initialize the API Client

Import the `GatewaySDK` class from `@gobob/bob-sdk` and create an instance of it.

```ts title="/src/utils/gateway.ts"
import { GatewayQuoteParams, GatewaySDK } from "@gobob/bob-sdk";

const gatewaySDK = new GatewaySDK("bob"); // or "bob-sepolia"
```

### Get Available Tokens

Returns an array of available output tokens for you to offer the user. Typically rendered as a drop-down menu. See [our SDK's source code](https://github.com/bob-collective/bob/blob/9c52341033af1ccbe388e64ef97a23bf6c07ccc7/sdk/src/gateway/tokens.ts#L8) for type information.

```ts
const outputTokens = await gatewaySDK.getTokens();
```

### Get a Quote

Call the `getQuote` method with your `quoteParams`. Example values shown here.

:::tip Updating the quote
We recommend rendering `quote.fee` and [its other fields](https://github.com/bob-collective/bob/blob/9c52341033af1ccbe388e64ef97a23bf6c07ccc7/sdk/src/gateway/client.ts#L15) for a clear UX. You can update the quote dynamically, such as with the `onChange` event.
:::

```ts
const quoteParams: GatewayQuoteParams = {
  fromToken: "BTC",
  fromChain: "Bitcoin",
  fromUserAddress: "bc1qafk4yhqvj4wep57m62dgrmutldusqde8adh20d",
  toChain: "BOB",
  toUserAddress: "0x2D2E86236a5bC1c8a5e5499C517E17Fb88Dbc18c",
  toToken: "tBTC", // or e.g. "SolvBTC"
  amount: 10000000, // 0.1 BTC
  gasRefill: 10000, // 0.0001 BTC. The amount of BTC to swap for ETH for tx fees.
};

const quote = await gatewaySDK.getQuote(quoteParams);
```

#### Get available staking or lending contracts

The SDK will handle automatically when the `toToken` has a fungible ERC20 token, but sometimes there is no representation. In that case we can list the available integrations and specify that in the quote.

```ts
const strategies = await gatewaySDK.getStrategies();
const strategy = strategies.find(
  (contract) => contract.integration.name === "pell-wbtc"
)!;
const quoteParamsStaking: GatewayQuoteParams = {
  ...quoteParams,
  toChain: strategy.chain.chainId,
  toToken: strategy.inputToken.symbol, // "wbtc"
  strategyAddress: strategy.address,
};
```

### Start the Order

This locks in the quote, placing a hold on the LP's funds. Pass the same `quoteParams` as before and the `quote` returned from the previous step.

Returns a `uuid` for the order and `psbtBase64`, a partially-signed Bitcoin transaction (PSBT) the user must sign.

```ts
const { uuid, psbtBase64 } = await gatewaySDK.startOrder(quote, quoteParams);
```

### Sign the Bitcoin Transaction

Create a Bitcoin transaction that sends the quoted `amount` of BTC to the LP's `bitcoinAddress`. This also publishes a hash of the order's parameters in the `OP_RETURN` of the transaction so the Gateway can trustlessly verify the order on BOB.

<TabItem value="sats-wagmi" label="sats-wagmi (Recommended)">

Please follow the [guide here](/learn/builder-guides/sats-wagmi.md) to install and use sats-wagmi. In this example, we sign the `psbtBase64` using sats-wagmi which abstracts the complex wallet logic for multiple connectors (including OKX, UniSat and Xverse).

It is also possible to directly use the `useSendGatewayTransaction` hook, example below.

```tsx
const { uuid, psbtBase64 } = await gatewaySDK.startOrder(quote, quoteParams);
const bitcoinTxHex = await connector.signAllInputs(psbtBase64!);
await gatewaySDK.finalizeOrder(uuid, bitcoinTxHex);
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="send-okx" label="Send (OKX)">

Please refer to the [OKX docs](https://www.okx.com/web3/build/docs/sdks/chains/bitcoin/introduce) for more information.
In this example, instead of signing the `psbtBase64` we instead use the in-built wallet methods to directly send the BTC.

```ts
const { uuid, bitcoinAddress, satoshis, opReturnHash } =
  await gatewaySDK.startOrder(quote, quoteParams);
const { txhash } = await window.okxwallet.bitcoin.send({
  from: quoteParams.fromUserAddress,
  to: bitcoinAddress,
  value: satoshis.toString(),
  memo: opReturnHash,
});
await gatewaySDK.finalizeOrder(uuid, txhash);
```

### Finalize the Order

Submit the Bitcoin transaction as proof of transfer. This completes the process by transferring wrapped Bitcoin and ETH to the user's EVM address on BOB.

Gateway can broadcast the Bitcoin transaction to the mempool; you can pass the transaction to the SDK without broadcasting from the user's wallet.

```ts
// NOTE: Gateway broadcasts the transaction
await gatewaySDK.finalizeOrder(uuid, tx.hex);
```

### Monitor the User's Orders

Get an array of pending and completed orders for a specific EVM address. Typically rendered in a table.

```ts
const orders = await gatewaySDK.getOrders(userAddress);
```

## Conclusion

BOB Gateway enables staking, swapping, lending, and bridging Bitcoin with a single transaction. The BOB SDK makes it possible for you to bring Gateway and Bitcoin LSTs directly to your users.

See the [Code References](#code-references) below for a deeper look at the SDK and an example implementation file.

We look forward to seeing what you Build on Bitcoin!

## Security and Trust Assumptions

The protocol requires zero trust between the market makers and users because it utilizes atomic cross-chain swaps. The verification of the Bitcoin transaction is performed cryptographically by an on-chain Bitcoin [Light Client](/learn/builder-guides/relay.md), making the swap trustless between both parties.

Furthermore, infrastructure run by the BOB team never has access to the market markers' tBTC, wBTC, or ETH funds stored in their smart contracts. The user interface and server manage order flow to prevent liquidity sniping and user errors (e.g. sending BTC without sufficient liquidity being available), but neither the front end or back end ever have access to users' or market makers' funds.

The code has been [audited by Pashov and Common Prefix](/learn/reference/audits#bob-gateway).
