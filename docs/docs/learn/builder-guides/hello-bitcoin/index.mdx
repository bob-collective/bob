# Hello Bitcoin

This guide provides step-by-step instructions on how to deploy a smart contract on BOB that interacts with Bitcoin.

BOB is EVM-based and we recommend using the [Solidity](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.24/) language to write your smart contracts. The base currency on BOB is ETH. Since BOB is a rollup on Ethereum, you can bridge over ETH from Ethereum to pay for transactions.

:::tip

If you are new to Solidity, we recommend checking out the [Solidity getting started guide](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.24/introduction-to-smart-contracts.html#subcurrency-example) to get a better understanding of the language.

:::

Developing Solidity contracts is made a lot easier using a development toolchain. Two of the most popular ones are [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/) and [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/). We will use these tools to develop and deploy our smart contract.
We will provide instructions for using Remix and Foundry.

- [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/) is a web-based IDE for writing smart contracts. This is a great option if you do not want to install any software on your computer.
- [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/) is a Rust-based development environment for writing smart contracts. This is a great option if you want to use a local development environment.

Solidity and a toolchain are sufficient to get you started deploying contracts on BOB. However, since BOB's purpose is to make it easy to interact with Bitcoin, we will also add parts of the BOB SDK as part of the starter kit.

- [BOB Starter Kit](https://github.com/bob-collective/bob-starter-kit): The kit serves as a quick start way to develop on BOB using the BOB SDK. Note: you can deploy any EVM contract on BOB without having to use the BOB SDK contracts. They are primarily a helper when you want to interact with Bitcoin from your smart contracts.

## HelloBitcoin Contract

### Overview of the contract

- The contract allows swapping between BTC->USDT and Ordinal->USDT using the BTC relay on testnet without requiring the BTC or ordinals to be bridged to BOB.
- The contract integrates the [BTC relay](https://github.com/bob-collective/bob/blob/master/src/relay/LightRelay.sol) to enable trustless communication between the Bitcoin blockchain and BOB Sepolia (Testnet).

### Objectives

- **Set up a development environment**: Learn how to set up a development environment for your BOB smart contract development.
- **Create a Smart Contract for BOB**: We will use [HelloBitcoin smart contract](https://github.com/bob-collective/StarterKit/blob/main/src/HelloBitcoin.sol) present in the developer kit.
- **Compile a Smart Contract for BOB**: Compile your HelloBitcoin smart contract using the development environment.
- **Deploy a Smart Contract to BOB**: Deploy your compiled smart contract to BOB Sepolia (Testnet).
- **Interact with a Smart Contract Deployed on BOB**: Learn how to interact with the smart contract you've deployed on BOB Sepolia (Testnet).

### Prerequisites

We start with installing the prerequisites for the development environment.

- Get Sepolia ETH and bridge them to BOB. Use the links on the [Connect to BOB](/learn/user-guides/networks) page.
- Setup either Remix or Foundry as your development environment. If you want to get started without having to install software, use Remix. If you are planning to develop more complex contracts, use Foundry.

<Tabs groupId="dev-env">
  <TabItem value="foundry" label="Foundry">

Follow the steps from the [foundry book](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation) to install the Foundry toolsuite, which contains the `forge`, `cast`, `anvil` and `chisel` tools.

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="remix" label="Remix">

Open the [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/) in your browser.

### Creating the HelloBitcoin Contract

<Tabs groupId="dev-env">

  <TabItem value="foundry" label="Foundry">

Clone the starter toolkit provided.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/bob-collective/bob-starter-kit.git
cd bob-starter-kit
```

The `HelloBitcoin` contract should already be present inside the src directory.

Checkout the contract by opening it in your favorite editor or IDE.

:::tip

If you are using [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), use the [Solidity plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=NomicFoundation.hardhat-solidity) to get syntax highlighting and other features.

:::

:::tip

It's not required to create a new contract, but if you want to create a new contract, you can do so by creating a new file in the `src` directory.

```shell
touch src/<Contract_Name>.sol
```

:::

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="remix" label="Remix">
  Create a new project with Remix. Under `contracts` folder create a new file `HelloBitcoin.sol`.

Add the following remappings in `compiler_config.json` under `settings`

```json
{
  "language": "Solidity",
  "settings": {
    "optimizer": {
      "enabled": true,
      "runs": 200

      "@bob-collective/bob/=https://github.com/bob-collective/bob/blob/master/src/"
    ]
  }
}
```

Enter the below code in `HelloBitcoin.sol` file.

Also create a `TestLightRelay.sol` file for deploying your own bitcoin relay.

```solidity

import {BTCUtils} from "@bob-collective/bitcoin-spv/BTCUtils.sol";
import "@bob-collective/bob/relay/LightRelay.sol";

/**
* @title HelloBitcoin
* @dev contract allows swapping between BTC->USDT and Ordinal->USDT using the BTC relay on testnet.
* @custom:dev-run-script ./scripts/deploy_relay.ts

    using BTCUtils for bytes;
    using BTCUtils for uint256;

      /// @notice Sets the current and previous difficulty based on the difficulty
      ///         inferred from the provided Bitcoin headers.
    function setDifficultyFromHeaders(bytes memory bitcoinHeaders) external {

        currentEpochDifficulty = firstHeaderDiff;
        prevEpochDifficulty = firstHeaderDiff;
    }
}

```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Compile the Contract

<Tabs groupId="dev-env">
  <TabItem value="foundry" label="Foundry">

To compile the contract run the following command:

```shell
forge build
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="remix" label="Remix">

In `Advanced Configurations` section of Solidity Compiler switch from `Compiler configuration` to `Use configuration file`.

![Advance remix configuration image](advance_remix_configuration.png)

To compile the contract, go to the `Solidity Compiler` section of the IDE, select and compile the `HelloBitcoin` smart contract.
You can also directly compile the `HelloBitcoin` smart contract by right-clicking on the `HelloBitcoin.sol` file and select compile.
In the same way `TestLightRelay.sol` contract should also be compiled.

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Deploy the HelloBitcoin Contract

<Tabs groupId="dev-env">
  <TabItem value="foundry" label="Foundry">

To deploy the contract via the terminal, you'll need your private key. We recommend generating a separate key for development purposes.

:::tip

If you are using MetaMask, use this [guide](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360015289632-How-to-export-an-account-s-private-key) to export your private key.

:::

To deploy the compiled smart contract on testnet we will use the `HelloBitcoin` script present under `scripts/HelloBitcoin.sol`:

```shell
export PRIVATE_KEY=0x<your-private-key>
export USDT_ADDRESS=0xF58de5056b7057D74f957e75bFfe865F571c3fB6
export RPC_URL=https://testnet.rpc.gobob.xyz
export VERIFIER_URL=https://testnet-explorer.gobob.xyz/api?

forge script script/HelloBitcoin.sol --rpc-url=$RPC_URL --broadcast \
--verify --verifier blockscout --verifier-url=$VERIFIER_URL \
--priority-gas-price 1
```

The output in the terminal should look similar to this:

```shell

To deploy the compiled HelloBitcoin smart contract first open the MetaMask extension and make sure the wallet is connected to the BOB network.

Choose the Remix `ENVIRONMENT` and `Injected Provider - MetaMask`. Remix will deploy contract to connected network, i.e., BOB.

Select contract as `TestLightRelay`. Click `Deploy` and sign the transaction pop up message.

![Remix IDE image](test_light_relay.png)

Copy the `TestLightRelay` contract address from the terminal this will be used as a constructor argument for `HelloBitcoin` contract.

Select contract as `HelloBitcoin`.

Add the `_RELAY` ie `TestLightRelay` address copied above.

Add the `_USDTCONTRACTADDRESS` address as `0xF58de5056b7057D74f957e75bFfe865F571c3fB6`.

:::tip
If you want, you can also modify the contract at a later stage and use [other ERC20 contracts already deployed on BOB Sepolia (Testnet)](/learn/reference/contracts).

Click `Deploy` and sign the transaction pop up message.

### Congratulations! You are done!

Congratulations! You have successfully deployed your first smart contract on BOB.

### Extra: Publish and verify the HelloBitcoin Contract

<Tabs groupId="dev-env">
  <TabItem value="foundry" label="Foundry">

The deployment script provided above already handles contract verification.

You can find the contract source code in the "Code" tab, along with new "Read Contract" and "Write Contract" sub-tabs. You are now ready to interact with the contract directly on the explorer.

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="remix" label="Remix">

At this point, your smart contract is ready to be used, but we can go a step further to verify and publish the smart contract in the explorer. By doing this you will be able to interact with any existing read or write calls in the contract right on the explorer. To do so follow these steps:

1. Go to the Remix IDE. Check if the contract imports other contracts. If it does, check step 2. If it doesn't, simply copy the contract code into your clipboard and jump to step 3.

2. In case your contract imports other contract, you need to flatten your contract. To do that you just need right click your contract file in Remix IDE file explorer and copy the flattened code into your clipboard.

![Flatten contract on Remix IDE](remix_ide_flatten.png)

3. Head over to the [testnet explorer](https://testnet-explorer.gobob.xyz/) and search for your published contract page.

4. Click on the "Contract" tab and click on "Verify & Publish" button.

![Explore Tab on the chain explorer](explorer_code_tab.png)

5. Click on the "Code" tab and click on "Verify & Publish" button.

6. Now you should be presented we a set of possibilities for verifying you published contract, but we will proceed with "Via flattened source code".

7. Fill the form with the specific information about the contract and how it was deployed. Make sure every field is correctly populated before submitting. Any incorrect field will lead to a failed verification. After submitting, the verification might take a couple of minutes.

8. Once submitted correctly, the contract source code should be visible in the "Code" tab, alongside with new "Read Contract" and "Write Contract". You are now ready to interact with the contract right on the explorer.
