# Audits

## BOB Mainnet

In Phase 1 of our [roadmap](/learn/introduction/roadmap.md), "Optimistic BOB" is an OP-stack rollup on Ethereum. We inherit the hard work of the Optimism Collective, including the many [security reviews](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/tree/v1.1.4/technical-documents/security-reviews) they have secured for our infrastructure.

## BOB Gateway

BOB's most novel product is our intent-based Bitcoin bridge, called "[BOB Gateway](/learn/user-guides/onboard-to-bob/bob-gateway/)." The reports below show the results of audits for every major release so far.
