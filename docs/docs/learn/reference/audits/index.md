# Audits

## BOB Mainnet

In Phase 1 of our [roadmap](/learn/introduction/roadmap), "Optimistic BOB" is an OP-stack rollup on Ethereum. We inherit the hard work of the Optimism Collective, including the many [security reviews](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/tree/v1.1.4/technical-documents/security-reviews) they have secured for our infrastructure.

## BOB Gateway

BOB's most novel product is our intent-based Bitcoin bridge, called "[BOB Gateway](/learn/user-guides/onboard-to-bob/bob-gateway/)." The reports below show the results of audits for every major release so far.

## FusionLock Contract

BOB's "Fusion Season One" campaign preceded our mainnet launch. Users had the option of depositing their tokens into a `FusionLock.sol` smart contract with the intention of bridging those assets to BOB mainnet once it went live. In preparation for that campaign, we contracted reviews of the FusionLock contract from several auditing firms.
