# Cross-chain

## LayerZero

LayerZero is a technology that enables applications to move data across blockchains, uniquely supporting censorship-resistant messages and permissionless development through immutable smart contracts. Projects on BOB can connect to 35+ supported blockchains using LayerZero's contracts.

Visit [LayerZero's documentation](https://docs.layerzero.network/v2) to learn more about their supported chains, data schema, omnichain fungible tokens (OFTs), and other useful guides. Their [GitHub repository](https://github.com/LayerZero-Labs) and [Discord](https://discord-layerzero.netlify.app/discord) are also wonderful resources for getting started.

### Supported Networks

**Supported Networks**

- [BOB Mainnet](https://docs.layerzero.network/v2/developers/evm/technical-reference/deployed-contracts#bob)
- [BOB Testnet](https://docs.layerzero.network/v2/developers/evm/technical-reference/deployed-contracts#bob-testnet)

:::warning BOB Testnet is not BOB Sepolia
For historical reasons, the smart contracts in the link above point to our previous testnet, "BOB Testnet". While it has been replaced by our newer testnet, "BOB Sepolia", the LayerZero contracts remain live on BOB Testnet.
