# Data Indexers

## Goldsky

[Goldsky](https://goldsky.com/) is a data indexer for web3 builders, offering high-performance subgraph hosting and realtime data replication pipelines.

Their [subgraphs](https://goldsky.com/products/subgraphs) are fully spec-compliant with every subgraph on The Graph’s hosted and decentralized networks. Smart APIs automatically create a subgraph from any smart contract ABI, so you don’t have to.

[Mirror](https://goldsky.com/products/mirror) streams live crypto data to your backend database, giving you more control & flexibility than traditional APIs.

## SQD

[SQD](https://sqd.dev/) is a decentralized hyper-scalable data platform optimized for providing efficient, permissionless access to large volumes of data. It currently serves historical on-chain data, including event logs, transaction receipts, traces, and per-transaction state diffs. SQD offers a powerful toolkit for creating custom data extraction and processing pipelines, achieving an indexing speed of up to 150k blocks per second.

To get started, visit the [documentation](https://docs.sqd.dev/) or see [EVM examples](https://github.com/subsquid-labs/squid-evm-examples) of what you can build with SQD.

## SubQuery

[SubQuery SDK](https://subquery.network/) allows developers to get rich indexed data and build intuitive and immersive decentralised applications in a faster and more efficient way. Another one of SubQuery's competitive advantages is the ability to aggregate data not only within a chain but across multiple blockchains all within a single project. This allows the creation of feature-rich dashboard analytics and multi-chain block scanners. Other advantages include superior performance with multiple RPC endpoint configurations, multi-worker capabilities and a configurable caching architecture.
