# BOB Gateway

## Bridge from Bitcoin to BOB

[BOB Gateway](https://app.gobob.xyz) lets you stake, swap, or lend your bitcoin from a single, unified interface so you can put your bitcoin to work earning yield faster than ever before.

It's built on a trustless, RFQ-based cross-chain [swap protocol](../../../build/examples/btc-swap/) that connects professional LPs with users through a seamless swapping experience. Essentially, LPs handle the complexities of bridging and staking on behalf of users in exchange for a fee.

:::tip Interested in providing liquidity?

All you need is a Bitcoin wallet with some BTC to send and an EVM-compatible wallet to receive your Bitcoin LST/LRT or wrapped Bitcoin on BOB. We'll even send you some ETH to cover the fees of your first few transactions on BOB.
