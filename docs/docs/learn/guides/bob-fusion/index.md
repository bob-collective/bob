### Stacking BOB Partner Points

Most of BOB’s dApp partners, like Solv, Bedrock, and FBTC, have introduced points programs. Users can also collect Babylon points by using partner LSTs on BOB. Season 3 enables triple harvesting across different partners, allowing you to stack points alongside Spice. Explore the dApps and choose your favorites. DYOR!

### Early Bird Launch Event

In the first hours and days after launch, an early bird bonus is up for grabs. All Spice that you harvest in Season 3 before BOB achieves a DeFi TVL of $75M will be doubled. The sooner you start harvesting, the greater your early bird bonus can be.

Check out [our blog](https://blog.gobob.xyz/posts/bob-fusion-the-final-season) for detailed info & multiplier strategies for Fusion Season 3.

## FAQs

### What is the gas token on BOB?

ETH. BOB fees are low, similar to OP chain fees. Learn more at [l2fees.info](https://l2fees.info/)

### My assets are on an exchange. How can I contribute?

Withdraw your assets as well as sufficient ETH for gas fees from a centralized exchange to the Ethereum network or any supported L2 like Arbitrum, Optimism, Base, etc.

If you’re a Coinbase user, withdrawing to the base network is free & then you can bridge your assets to BOB for low gas fees.

Use the [BOB bridge](https://app.gobob.xyz/bridge) or any other listed bridge providers to bridge your assets to the BOB network.

### What happens to my Season 1 & 2 points?

Season 1 and 2 points are being counted separately from Season 3 points. They can be found on the dashboard under Season 3 points.

### I have deployed capital into some dApps but they’re not distributing Spice very regularly

Please note some dApps plan to distribute Spice retroactively at some point in the future, so if you have used the dApp during that snapshot time, you will get your Spice, albeit the distribution timelines depend on the dApps.

If you are unhappy about a dApp’s Spice distribution, your best options are to either voice your concerns to that dApp or look for other opportunities in the BOB Fusion campaign.

### What happens to the referrals I made in Season 1 & 2?

Your referral bonus will continue into Season 3 if your Season 1 & 2 invites (& their invites) also participate & harvest Spice into Season 3. Your invite code will remain the same in Season 3 so you can invite more people as well for bonus Spice.

### Is there a distinction between how much Spice I can earn with different dApps as an LP?

Yes! More risk and effort = more Spice.

Example: DEXes harvest more than lending.
There will be regular calls to action for specific assets or pools that can get bonuses.

### What’s the maximum amount of Spice for the Fusion campaign?

There is no limit. The more TVL and activity, the more Spice distribution. Stay active in the ecosystem, to defend and grow your position.
