You may choose to use a “3rd Party” bridge. Each of these buttons will direct you to that bridge’s website. For the rest of this guide we’ll use the “BOB Bridge.”

10. That’s it! After ~3 minutes your tokens will be bridged to BOB. You can verify the bridging is complete with the Activity section on the right or by clicking “Withdraw” and seeing that your token balance on BOB has increased.
