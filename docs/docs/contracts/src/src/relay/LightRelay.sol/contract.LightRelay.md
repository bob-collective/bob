## Functions
### relayActive


```solidity
modifier relayActive();
```

### genesis

Establish a starting point for the relay by providing the
target, timestamp and blockheight of the first block of the relay
genesis epoch.

*If the relay is used by querying the current and previous epoch
difficulty, at least one retarget needs to be provided after genesis;
otherwise the prevEpochDifficulty will be uninitialised and zero.*


```solidity
function genesis(bytes calldata genesisHeader, uint256 genesisHeight, uint64 genesisProofLength) external onlyOwner;
```
**Parameters**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`genesisHeader`|`bytes`|The first block header of the genesis epoch.|
|`genesisHeight`|`uint256`|The block number of the first block of the epoch.|
|`genesisProofLength`|`uint64`|The number of blocks required to accept a proof.|


### setProofLength

Set the number of blocks required to accept a header chain.

*For production, a high number (e.g. 20-50) is recommended.
Small numbers are accepted but should only be used for testing.*


```solidity
function setProofLength(uint64 newLength) external relayActive onlyOwner;
```
**Parameters**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`newLength`|`uint64`|The required number of blocks. Must be less than 2016.|


### setAuthorizationStatus

Set whether the relay requires retarget submitters to be
pre-authorised by governance.


```solidity
function setAuthorizationStatus(bool status) external onlyOwner;
```
**Parameters**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`status`|`bool`|True if authorisation is to be required, false if not.|


### authorize

Authorise the given address to submit retarget proofs.


```solidity
function authorize(address submitter) external onlyOwner;
```
**Parameters**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`submitter`|`address`|The address to be authorised.|


### deauthorize

Rescind the authorisation of the submitter to retarget.


```solidity
function deauthorize(address submitter) external onlyOwner;
```
**Parameters**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`submitter`|`address`|The address to be deauthorised.|


### retarget

Add a new epoch to the relay by providing a proof
of the difficulty before and after the retarget.

*Checks that the first X blocks are valid in the most recent epoch,
that the difficulty of the new epoch is calculated correctly according
to the block timestamps, and that the next X blocks would be valid in
the new epoch.
We have no information of block heights, so we cannot enforce that
retargets only happen every 2016 blocks; instead, we assume that this
is the case if a valid proof of work is provided.
It is possible to cheat the relay by providing X blocks from earlier in
the most recent epoch, and then mining X new blocks after them.
However, each of these malicious blocks would have to be mined to a
higher difficulty than the legitimate ones.
Alternatively, if the retarget has not been performed yet, one could
first mine X blocks in the old difficulty with timestamps set far in
the future, and then another X blocks at a greatly reduced difficulty.
In either case, cheating the relay requires more work than mining X
legitimate blocks.
Only the most recent epoch is vulnerable to these attacks; once a
retarget has been proven to the relay, the epoch is immutable even if a
contradictory proof were to be presented later.*


```solidity
function retarget(bytes memory headers) external relayActive;
```
**Parameters**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`headers`|`bytes`|A chain of headers including the last X blocks before the retarget, followed by the first X blocks after the retarget, where X equals the current proof length.|


### validateChain

Check whether a given chain of headers should be accepted as
valid within the rules of the relay.
If the validation fails, this function throws an exception.

*A chain of headers is accepted as valid if:
- Its length is between 2 and 2015 headers.
- Headers in the chain are sequential and refer to previous digests.
- Each header is mined with the correct amount of work.
- The difficulty in each header matches an epoch of the relay,
as determined by the headers' timestamps. The headers must be between
the genesis epoch and the latest proven epoch (inclusive).
If the chain contains a retarget, it is accepted if the retarget has
already been proven to the relay.
If the chain contains blocks of an epoch that has not been proven to
the relay (after a retarget within the header chain, or when the entire
chain falls within an epoch that has not been proven yet), it will be
rejected.
One exception to this is when two subsequent epochs have exactly the
same difficulty; headers from the latter epoch will be accepted if the
previous epoch has been proven to the relay.
This is because it is not possible to distinguish such headers from
headers of the previous epoch.
If the difficulty increases significantly between relay genesis and the
present, creating fraudulent proofs for earlier epochs becomes easier.
Users of the relay should check the timestamps of valid headers and
only accept appropriately recent ones.*


```solidity
function validateChain(bytes memory headers)
    external
    view
    returns (uint256 startingHeaderTimestamp, uint256 headerCount);
```
**Parameters**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`headers`|`bytes`|A chain of 2 to 2015 bitcoin headers.|

**Returns**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`startingHeaderTimestamp`|`uint256`|The timestamp of the first header.|
|`headerCount`|`uint256`|The number of headers.|


### getBlockDifficulty

Get the difficulty of the specified block.


```solidity
function getBlockDifficulty(uint256 blockNumber) external view returns (uint256);
```
**Parameters**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`blockNumber`|`uint256`|The number of the block. Must fall within the relay range (at or after the relay genesis, and at or before the end of the most recent epoch proven to the relay).|

**Returns**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`<none>`|`uint256`|The difficulty of the epoch.|


### getRelayRange

Get the range of blocks the relay can accept proofs for.

*Assumes that the genesis has been set correctly.
Additionally, if the next epoch after the current one has the exact
same difficulty, headers for it can be validated as well.
This function should be used for informative purposes,
e.g. to determine whether a retarget must be provided before submitting
a header chain for validation.*


```solidity
function getRelayRange() external view returns (uint256 relayGenesis, uint256 currentEpochEnd);
```
**Returns**

|Name|Type|Description|

*returns 0 if the relay is not ready.*

**Returns**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`<none>`|`uint256`|The difficulty of the epoch.|


### validateHeader

digest of the previous header (if provided), and has sufficient work.
