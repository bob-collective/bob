# Give Users Free Transactions

## Sponsor Your Users' Transactions With Safe Gas Station

BOB believes that users deserve next-gen UX, including abstracting away the complexity of transaction fees from users. That's why we're partnered with the [Safe\{Core\} Gas Station Program](https://safe.global/gas-station) to sponsor up to $150,000 of your users' transaction fees.

## Spice Things Up With BOB Fusion

In addition to sponsoring your users' transaction fees, we would like to invite any projects joining the Safe\{Core\} Gas Station Program to be a part of [BOB Fusion](/docs/learn/guides/bob-fusion/index.md). Check out the [BOB Fusion app](https://app.gobob.xyz/fusion) to see how we engage our community with weekly voting competitions, Spice harvesting bonuses, and links to our ecosystem of projects.
