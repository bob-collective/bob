## Emblem Vault

[Emblem Vault](https://twitter.com/EmblemVault) is an [interoperability](https://docs.emblem.wiki/) protocol that allows for the trading, transferring, and transacting of digital assets across blockchains. Vaulting is a propriety [crosschain](https://emblem.finance/createcurated) mechanism that is similar to bridging and wrapped assets but offers extended compatibility with any type of distributed ledger technology. Since 2020 Emblem Vault has been the leading multichain solutions for NFTs with over $100M in total value vaulted and $200M in trading activity.
