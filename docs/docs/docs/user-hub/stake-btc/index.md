# Guide: Stake BTC

## One-Click BTC Staking

[BOB Earn](https://app.gobob.xyz/stake?type=stake&stakeWith=solv-solvbtcbbn) is a new 1-click Bitcoin staking portal and [BOB Gateway](/docs/gateway/) for Bitcoin liquid staking. Harvest BOB Spice points in the final season of BOB Fusion by using BOB Earn and exploring the growing Bitcoin staking ecosystem on BOB.

It's built on a trustless, RFQ-based cross-chain swap protocol that connects professional LPs with users through a seamless swapping experience. LPs handle the complexities of bridging and staking on behalf of users in exchange for a fee.

All you need is a Bitcoin wallet with some BTC to send and an EVM-compatible wallet to receive your Bitcoin LST on BOB. We'll even send you some ETH to cover the fees of your first few transactions on BOB.

## Choose Your Wallet Setup

### Standard Setup
If you're using a regular Bitcoin wallet and EVM wallet, follow the [Standard Guide](#standard-guide) below.

### Ledger Hardware Wallet Setup
If you're using a Ledger hardware wallet, follow the [Ledger Guide](#ledger-guide) below.

## Standard Guide

## Ledger Guide

### Prerequisites

To complete this task you will need:
- A Ledger Hardware wallet with BTC on the Bitcoin network

That's it! You do not need any tokens on any EVM chain, including BOB. If you don't have an Ethereum or EVM address yet, this guide will show you how to create one in Ledger Live.

### Part One: Set Up Accounts

1. [Download the XVerse wallet](https://www.xverse.app/ledger-hardware-wallet-support). This will allow you to connect your Ledger's BTC account to the BOB Stake app.
2. [Connect your Ledger device to the XVerse wallet](https://support.xverse.app/hc/en-us/articles/17819233917965-How-to-Connect-Your-Ledger-Device-to-Xverse).
3. Create an EVM account for your Ledger device. This is sometimes also called an Ethereum address. We recommend these options:
   - Ledger Live: [Create an EVM account in Ledger Live](https://support.ledger.com/article/360009576554-zd)
   - MetaMask: [Connect your Ledger to MetaMask](https://support.ledger.com/article/4404366864657-zd)
   - Rabby: [Set up and use Rabby wallet to access your Ledger Ethereum (ETH) account](https://support.ledger.com/article/4409801559569-zd)
