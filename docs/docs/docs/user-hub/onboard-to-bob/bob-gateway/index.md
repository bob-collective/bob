# Bridge from Bitcoin to BOB

[BOB Gateway](https://docs.gobob.xyz/gateway) lets you stake, swap, or lend your bitcoin from a single, unified interface so you can put your bitcoin to work earning yield faster than ever before.

It's built on a trustless, RFQ-based cross-chain swap protocol that connects professional LPs with users through a seamless swapping experience. Essentially, LPs handle the complexities of bridging and staking on behalf of users in exchange for a fee.
