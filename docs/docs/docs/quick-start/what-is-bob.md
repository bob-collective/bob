# What is BOB?

## The Vision: Putting Bitcoin at the Heart of DeFi

Bitcoin represents the world's largest and most valuable digital asset, yet it remains largely untapped in DeFi. While Ethereum has achieved ~30% DeFi TVL penetration, Bitcoin sits at just 0.3%. BOB exists to bridge this gap, giving everyone access to Bitcoin's potential.

The Problem: Users and institutions want sustainable returns on their Bitcoin holdings, while projects and apps need liquidity in the world's most trusted asset.

## The Solution: BOB - The Gateway to Bitcoin DeFi

BOB combines the security of Bitcoin with the DeFi innovation of Ethereum, creating the best place to build and earn yield with BTC.

For Users: 1-click Bitcoin staking, cross-chain BTC swaps, and seamless DeFi access

For Developers: "Integrate BOB EVM, get native BTC access"

**Key Innovation:** "BTC on BOB is BTC" - The first chain to achieve finality from both Ethereum and Bitcoin.

## The Technology: The Hybrid Chain

BOB is an optimistic rollup with ZK proofs on Ethereum secured by billions of dollars of staked Bitcoin, serviced by a hybrid BitVM bridge for native BTC integration.
