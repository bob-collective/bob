# HybridBTC

HybridBTC is BOB's first yield-generating product, enabling Bitcoin holders to earn real yield on their BTC through BOB's cross-chain infrastructure. Like all BOB products, it reflects our commitment to making Bitcoin DeFi safer and more accessible by leveraging modern EVM tooling. We've unified best-in-class solutions into one seamless experience, from [paying fees with BTC](/docs/deprecated/bridged-btc-gas-fee), to [signing with your Bitcoin wallet](/docs/tools/account-abstraction#btc-connect), to [staking your BTC directly from Bitcoin](/docs/user-hub/stake-btc#ledger-guide). HybridBTC builds on this foundation to deliver secure, efficient yield generation for Bitcoin holders.

## Quick Overview

HybridBTC is a yield-generating product that allows Bitcoin holders to earn real yield on their BTC through BOB's cross-chain infrastructure. Key features include:

- Accepts deposits in multiple forms of wrapped BTC and BTC liquid staking tokens (LST)
- Generates yield denominated in BTC plus additional incentives
- No impermanent loss or liquidation risks
- Managed by Veda, a DeFi protocol with over $3B in TVL
- Yield is generated through deployment into Pendle pools and other DeFi opportunities
- HybridBTC.pendle tokens can be used in [BOB's DeFi ecosystem](https://app.gobob.xyz/apps) for additional yield sources

## How It Works

The HybridBTC.pendle vault operates across multiple chains to generate yield for BTC holders.

1. **Deposit**: Users deposit their wrapped BTC or BTC LST into the HybridBTC.pendle vault on Ethereum mainnet. (e.g. WBTC, tBTC, SolvBTC, xSolvBTC, or LBTC)

1. **Yield Generation**: The vault deploys deposited BTC into Pendle pools on Ethereum, selling users' Babylon and LST points for BTC-denominated returns.

1. **Token Receipt**: Users receive HybridBTC.pendle tokens on BOB representing their vault position and accruing yield.

1. **DeFi Yield**: The HybridBTC.pendle token can be used in BOB's DeFi ecosystem for even more yield. Read the [Yield Sources](#yield-sources) section below to learn more.

1. **Withdrawal**: Users can redeem their HybridBTC.pendle tokens at any time to receive their original BTC or LST plus accumulated yield.

### Privileged Roles and Security

The vault employs a multi-layered security model:

- üîê **Distributed Control**: The vault will be a shared 4-of-6 multi-sig Safe between Veda and BOB. A majority of signers is required to make any changes to the strategy, such as accepting new assets or whitelisting new markets.
- üëÄ **Transparent Operations**: The on-chain strategies can be monitored to verify execution and prevent misuse of funds.
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Strategy Constraints**: Each vault is limited to a pre-defined mandate that defines its deployment and risk management parameters.

## Yield Sources

The HybridBTC.pendle vault generates multiple sources of yield:

1. **Base Yield**:

   - Generated from Pendle pool deployments
   - Real yield denominated in BTC
   - No impermanent loss risk

1. **Additional Incentives**:

   - Additional rewards for vault participants
   - At launch, users receive Veda points and $OP tokens

1. **Optional DeFi Strategies on BOB**:

   - Provide liquidity in DEX pools to earn trading fees
   - Use as collateral in lending protocols like Euler v2
   - Borrow additional BTC or other assets to leverage yield positions
   - Participate in leveraged yield farming
   - Note: These additional strategies may involve different risk profiles
