# Privileged Roles in BOB Mainnet

BOB uses the [OP Stack](https://docs.optimism.io/stack/getting-started), just like Optimism Mainnet and Base. As a result, BOB is on the same [Pragmatic Path to Decentralization](https://medium.com/ethereum-optimism/our-pragmatic-path-to-decentralization-cb5805ca43c1).

For now, OP Stack chains still include "privileged" roles that allow certain addresses to carry out specific actions. Read this page to understand these roles, why they exist, and what risks they pose.

## L1 Proxy Admin

### Mitigations

- L1 Proxy Admin owner is a 4-of-6 [multisig](https://etherscan.io/address/0xC91482A96e9c2A104d9298D1980eCCf8C4dc764E#readProxyContract).

## ERC20 Contract Upgrade Proxy

### Description

The ERC20 Contract Upgrade Proxy is an address that can be used to upgrade four ERC20 contracts on BOB to new versions: USDC, tBTC, wstETH, and STONE. This is a temporary measure:

- USDC: The ERC20 is upgradable to allow Circle to take over the contract to enable native minting and redeeming on BOB.
- tBTC: The ERC20 is upgradable to allow Threshold governance to take over the contract to enable native minting and redeeming on BOB.
- wstETH: The ERC20 is upgradable to allow Lido governance to take over the contract to control the contract from the Ethereum side.

All other ERC20 contracts on BOB are not upgradable by this proxy.

### Risks

- Compromised ERC20 Contract Upgrade Proxy could upgrade contracts to malicious versions.

### Mitigations

- USDC and wstETH Contract Upgrade Proxy is a 3-of-5 [multisig](https://explorer.gobob.xyz/address/0xAE554F69fEd747006BF48481A6629921c3cD2Ba5).
