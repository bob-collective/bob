# BitVM on BOB

:::info
BOB mainnet is live. BitVM is a new BTC bridge and is set to go live on mainnet in Q4 2025. You can try it out on testnet at [bitvm-testnet.gobob.xyz](https://bitvm-testnet.gobob.xyz/en).

## Current Status: BitVM Testnet

[BitVM](https://blog.gobob.xyz/posts/what-is-bitvm) is currently running on testnet with significant improvements and new features that set it apart from previous iterations. The testnet represents a major step forward in bringing native BTC to DeFi applications while maintaining Bitcoin's security guarantees.

### Key Testnet Features

#### 1. **BitVM Operator Split**
BOB has pioneered splitting the BitVM operator role into two distinct parts:
- **Operator Node**: Acts like a validator, performing complex BitVM operations
- **Operator LP**: Supplies BTC temporarily during pegout operations

This separation mirrors the validator/staker relationship in PoS networks, reducing the capital requirements for individual operators.

#### 2. **Data Availability on Ethereum**
Leveraging BOB's hybrid L2 design, BitVM uses Ethereum's cheaper data storage instead of Bitcoin:
- Challengers can access required data from Ethereum blobs
- Maintains the same censorship resistance as Ethereum rollups like Arbitrum or Base
- Significantly reduces costs compared to posting data to Bitcoin

#### 3. **Collateral Re-use**
Based on research by Citrea and CommonPrefix, BOB implements collateral re-use for operators:
- Fixed BTC collateral amount instead of scaling with BitVM instances
- Reduces capital requirements for operators
- Enables more efficient capital utilization

### Testnet Integration Partners

The current testnet features integration with partners running BitVM:
- **P2P.org**: Infrastructure and staking services
- **Lombard**: Digital asset management and institutional services
- **Solv Protocol**: DeFi infrastructure and yield optimization
- **Amber Group**: Digital asset platform and trading services
- **Ankr**: Web3 infrastructure and node services
- **RockawayX**: Blockchain infrastructure and investment
- **Fiamma**: DeFi protocol and yield strategies
- **UTXO Management**: Bitcoin-focused investment and infrastructure
- **Luganodes**: Blockchain infrastructure and node services
- **SatLayer**: Bitcoin Layer 2 infrastructure and development

### User Access via Gateway

Users can access BitVM BTC on BOB through the Gateway interface at [bitvm-testnet.gobob.xyz](https://bitvm-testnet.gobob.xyz/en). Gateway provides:
- Fast and cheap access to BitVM BTC
- 3-block confirmation time
- Complementary service to direct BitVM usage

## Roadmap

### Q4 2025: Mainnet Launch

The BitVM bridge, built by BOB and bitvm/acc partners, will launch on mainnet in Q4 2025. This launch represents:

- **Institutional Adoption**: Early collaboration with future operators to ensure BitVM meets real-world needs
- **Product Shaping**: Partners have the opportunity to influence product and client design
- **Security Alignment**: BitVM aligns BTC bridge security with Ethereum L2 standards through fraud-proof "1-of-N" security

### Beyond Mainnet

The roadmap extends beyond the initial mainnet launch with ongoing development focused on:

- **Ecosystem Growth**: Expanding the network of operators and partners
- **Security Enhancements**: Continuous improvement of the fraud-proof system
- **User Experience**: Streamlining access and reducing barriers to entry
- **Cross-chain Integration**: Expanding BitVM's reach across the broader blockchain ecosystem

### Long-term Vision

BitVM's long-term vision is to enable native BTC in DeFi applications while maintaining Bitcoin's security guarantees. This includes:

- **DeFi Integration**: Seamless BTC usage in DeFi protocols
- **Institutional Adoption**: Meeting the needs of institutional players
- **Decentralization**: Maintaining maximal decentralization and censorship resistance
- **Scalability**: Supporting growing demand while maintaining security
